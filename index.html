  <p><em>Grant me the serenity to accept things that I cannot change; <br>The courage to change what I can; <br>And the wisdom to know the difference.</em></p>

    <p>Over the years, I have visited many cities and several countries. I love to travel. One of my favorite places that I visited was                                                          
       South Korea. It is a beautiful country with lots of scenery.  The trick is to get out of Seoul.  Although, the city of Seoul has a lot to offer,
       it is a metropolitan area.  Therefore, it has everything one would expect to see in a major city. 
    </p>
    <p>  
       Upon leaving Seoul, the entire perception of the country will change.  I was fortunate enough to take the trip with a native, well-known Tae Kwon Do Grandmaster
       along with some other martial artists.  Due to the Grandmaster's connections, we had a well-planned experience that took us to various restaurants, temples, monasteries,
       museums,etc. We were even able to participate in the <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.chuncheonkoreaopen.org/eng/sub/sub02_01.asp">Chuncheon Korea Open</a>, an international
       taekwondo tournament. 
    </p>    
    <p>
       My favorite parts of the trip were the hours that we spent with monks at a couple of different monasteries. On one particular day, we
       went to a temple high up in the mountains. It was a beautiful day with mild temperatures and a slight overcast. The
       monks instructed us to to gather in a circle so that we could meditate. I positioned myself so that I could face a majestic
       mountain. The view was similiar to that of the <a href="#juwang">Juwang mountain</a> that one would see while visiting Daejeonsa, the 
       largest temple in Cheonsong-gun. As I sat meditating, I felt an overwhelming sense of serenity. Typically, I'm not a fan of meditation. However, on that particular day, 
       I was content with the activity on that day. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks lead a simple existence. Some monks never leave their respective monasteries. As a westerner, it's hard to imagine life without everything that we have access to on
      a daily basis.  However, I found myself seriously thinking about how I could take a sabbatical and just escape the daily grind for a couple of months. I think that it would be interesting
      to learn some life skills from the monks. During lunch at the monastery, one of monks stated, "We are not allowed to put more food on a plate than we can eat". 
      The statement was simple yet profound because these monks grow their own food.

      Regardless of a person's position regarding spirituality or religion, it would be almost impossible to ignore the spiritual aura that encompasses
      the country. Based on experience, I would recommend visiting a few of the following sites: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monastaries</li>
      <li>Museums</li>
      <li>Temples</li>
    </ul>
