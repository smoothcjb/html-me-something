    <p>Over the years, I have visited many cities and several countries. I love to travel. One of my favorite places that I visited was                                                          
       South Korea. It is a beautiful country with lots of scenery. Although, the city of Seoul has a lot to offer,
       it is a metropolitan area.  Therefore, it has everything one would expect to see in a major city. The secret is that one should get out of Seoul. 
    </p>
    <p>  
       Upon leaving Seoul, my entire perception of the country changed. I was fortunate enough to take the trip with a native, well-known Taekwondo Grandmaster
       along with some other martial artists. Due to the Grandmaster's connections, we had a well-planned experience that took us to various restaurants, temples, monasteries,
       museums, etc. We were even able to participate in the <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.chuncheonkoreaopen.org/eng/sub/sub02_01.asp">Chuncheon Korea Open</a>, an international
       taekwondo tournament. 
    </p>    
    <p>
       My favorite parts of the trip were the hours that we spent with monks at a couple of different monasteries. On one particular day, we
       went to a temple high up in the mountains. It was a beautiful day with mild temperatures and a slight overcast. The
       monks instructed us to to gather in a circle so that we could meditate. I positioned myself so that I could face a majestic
       mountain. The view was similiar to that of the <a href="#juwang">Juwang mountain</a> that one would see while visiting Daejeonsa, the 
       largest temple in Cheonsong-gun. As I sat meditating, I felt an overwhelming sense of serenity. Typically, I'm not a fan of meditation. However, on that particular day, 
       I was content with the activity.

      Monks lead a simple existence. Some monks never leave their respective monasteries. As a westerner, it's hard to imagine life without everything that we have access to on
      a daily basis. However, I found myself seriously thinking about how I could take a sabbatical and just escape the daily grind for a couple of months. I think that it would be interesting
      to learn some life skills from the monks. For example, one of monks stated during lunch that they were not not allowed to put more food on a plate than they could eat. 
      The statement was simple yet profound because those monks harvested their own food.   
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of a person's position regarding spirituality or religion, it would be almost impossible to ignore the spiritual aura of Far East. Based on my experience, I would 
      hightly recommend taking a trip South Korea. If immersing yourself in the culture to find a sense of calm doesn't sound appealing, there are plenty of entertainment and shopping options.
