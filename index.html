    <p>Over the years, I have visited many cities and several countries. I love to travel. One of my favorite places that I visited was                                                          
       South Korea. It is a beautiful country with lots of scenery.  The trick is to get out of Seoul.  Although, the city of Seoul has a lot to offer,
       it is a metropolitan area.  Therefore, it has everything one would expect to see in a major city.

       When you leave Seoul, the entire perception of the country will change.  I was fortunate enough to take the trip with a native, well-known Tae Kwon Do Grandmaster
       along with some other martial artists.  Due to the Grandmaster's connections, we had a well-planned experience that took us to various restaurants, temples, monasteries,
       museums,etc.  We were even able to participate in the <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.chuncheonkoreaopen.org/eng/sub/sub02_01.asp">Chuncheon Korea Open</a>, an international
       taekwondo tournament.

       My favorite parts of the trip were the hours that were spent with monks at a couple of different monasteries. On one particular day, we
       went to a temple high up in the mountains. It was a beautiful day with mild temperatures and a slight overcast. The
       monks instructed us to to gather in a circle so that we could meditate. I positioned myself so that I could face
       the mountain. The view was similiar to that of the Juwang mountain that one would see whle visiting <a href="#daejeonsa">Daejeonsa</a>,the 
       largest temple in Cheonsong-gun.

      As I sat meditating, I felt an overwhelming sense of serenity. Typically, I'm not a fan of meditation. On that particular day, I could've medidated
